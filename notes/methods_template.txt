Sequencing outputs were aligned to reference genomes using 10x Genomics Cell Ranger 7.1.0. Gene expression libraries were aligned to the GRCh38-2020-A build provided by 10X. B-cell repertoire sequencing data for bonemarrow samples was aligned to the 10X Human VDJ GRCh38 v7.1.0 reference.  Cellranger gene expression outputs were ran through SoupX [1] to estimate ambient RNA contamination; estimates for all captures were low (<3%), so no correction was performed. Filtered count matrices were read into R through Seurat [2] for further processing and analysis.  

  

Cells were filtered on a per-capture basis by removing outliers (exceeding 4 median absolute deviations) in common qc metrics: UMI count, feature count, mitochondrial gene expression proportion, ribosomal gene expression proportion, and log10 genes per UMI. DoubletFinder [3] was ran to predicted doublets, which were removed from the analysis. Log normalization, scaling, and variable feature identification for gene expression data were performed via Seurat's `NormalizeData`, `ScaleData`, and `FindVariableFeatures` functions. We used Seurat's `CellCycleScoring` to annotate cell cycle phase, but we did not observe an unwanted effect of cell-cycle in our clustering output, so we did not regress cell cycle score during the processing. Surface marker data was normalized via Seurat's CLR method applied across cells.  

  

Gene expression data was integrated across captures using Harmony [4] to identify conserved populations. Unsupervised clustering was performed on the integrated dataset by Seurat's `FindNeighbors` and `RunUMAP` functions. We used Clustree [5] to identify optimal resolution for cluster stability. High-level cell-type identification was provided by SingleR using the PBMC reference dataset from Seurat/10X. We corroborated calls from SingleR [7] using cluster markers calculated via Seurat's `FindMarkers`. We then separated the major subtypes of interest for independent analysis: T and NK cells, B cells, myeloid cells, and dendritic cells.  

  

The subsets of interest were re-integrated via Harmony and reprocessed using a Weighted Nearest Neighbors workflow to cluster cells using both gene expression and surface marker data [6]. We again used Clustree to identify an optimal resolution for each subset. Clusters were annotated based on reference dataset predictions from celldex [7] and cluster-level protein/gene markers.  

  

For each cell-population annotated, we performed differential gene expression using MAST [8]. For each population, we fit a model with fixed terms for 1) dominant Ig clonotype (IgA vs non-IgA) 2) timepoint (pre or post intervention) 3) interaction of clonotype and time, and 4) the cellular discovery rate (as described in the MAST paper), as well as a random effect for individual. The resulting R syntax formula takes the form: 

 
clonotype + time + clonotype:time + CDR + (1|individual) 

 

The differential gene expression output was further analyzed with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis via fGSEA [9] using pathways from the Molecular Signatures Database [10]. Composition analysis was performed using scCODA [11].
