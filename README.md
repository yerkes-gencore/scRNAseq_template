# scRNAseq_template

This repo can be cloned to initialize new repos for new single-cell analysis projects. Use the button
in the top right to make a new repo from this template. Many of the folders are empty and just serve
to set a constant directory structure across projects.

# Todo:
* Generalize runfile for processing (mostly taken from an analysis, not robustly tested)
* Test and clean clustering and ADT portions of processing runfile
* Add analysis scripts (DGE, cluster labeling, etc)
